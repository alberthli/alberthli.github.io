[_Tensegrities_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity) are structures traditionally comprised of rigid bars held in equilibrium by a network of cables. Originally explored by architects and civil engineers, it was not until relatively recently that actuated tensegrities were studied in the field of robotics. As robots, tensegrities enjoy benefits such as lightweight construction and adjustable compliance, exhibiting features of both fully rigid and fully soft robots.

This project studied what we term _compound tensegrities_, whose rigid elements are not just purely compressive bars, but can take on any arbitrary geometry (and therefore also admit net moments about each rigid body). This allows more faithful bio-inspired designs at the expense of complicating traditional tensegrity modeling techniques. In our work, we reformulate the classic _force density method_ used for computing equilibrium forces in network structures to allow for analysis of compound tensegrities and derive a fast optimization-based shape controller that can also be used for quasi-static position control. Finally, the method is validated both in simulation and on a simple hardware test case.

Humans are very skilled at spatiotemporal prediction, being able to predict the motion of objects or other agents with fairly minimal observations. This project sought to learn _latent dynamics models_ for the purpose of long-horizon spatiotemporal prediction on robots. As a prerequisite, we must be able to extract _latent states_ from sequences of _observations_. For example, we may be interested in predicting positions of objects (the states) from video frames (the observations). This process is called _posterior inference_.

Many conventional methods in the learning literature conduct posterior inference using an inference network like a bi-RNN, which consumes the data and returns an estimate over some latent state. As it turns out, this is unnecessary, as classical state estimation theory allows approximate inference using methods like the extended Kalman filter, which requires only a dynamics network and an observation model, eliminating the need for a third inference network.

We present results for such a model and also a new learning algorithm called _replay overshooting_ that prioritizes training the dynamics model over the observation model. We show that our method is effective on multiple types of data, such as stripped position data or image sequences, while remaining very parameter-efficient compared to existing methods in the literature. As an added bonus, our method allows seamlessly changing the learned model between discrete and continuous-time, the first such method that natively incorporates both perspectives for dynamics learning.

[[Paper]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/conference/cassie.pdf) [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLrz_R_T6kg) [[Media]](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/uc-berkeley-cassie-cal-robot-juggle)

To facilitate human-robot interactions and robotic multi-tasking in dynamical environments, we expect them to be able to reason accurately about contact. One of the simplest benchmarks for controlling via contact is the _robotic juggling_ task, which has been replicated before on quadrotors, robotic manipulators, and large humanoid robots.

This project studied _bounce juggling_ on the bipedal robot _Cassie_, developed by Agility Robotics. The distinguishing factor of this work is the difficulty of maintaining an active juggle while also balancing the robot, which is already a nontrivial task depending on the robot's environment. We derived two different juggling controllers, both inspired by _mirror law algorithms_: one based on a simple PID scheme on the ball position and another based on contact force optimization at the robot's feet to maintain balance while driving the juggling with sufficient force and precision.

We found that in simulation, both controllers were locally exponentially stable with Poincar√© analysis. We implemented the simpler of the two on Cassie and found that we were able to maintain stable juggles for long periods (with the longest period being over 40 juggles long). Unfortunately, I left Berkeley to start my MS near the end of this project, and we did not have time to implement the second controller online.

<summary><b>[C1] Dex-Net 3.0: Computing Robust Vacuum Suction Grasp Targets in Point Clouds Using a New Analytic Model and Deep Learning (2018)</b></summary>

[[Paper]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/conference/dexnet.pdf) [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZIHmcaTJ_c&feature=emb_title) [[Code]](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/dex-net)

Vacuum-based grasping and manipulation is a popular alternative to traditional parallel-jaw methods, since we only need to compute a single point of contact and we may be able to lift objects that are difficult to grasp otherwise. The goal of this project was deriving an analytical physics-based suction model, training a grasping planner to find good suction points on various objects from point cloud data, and implementing the system on a real robot.

My role on the project was designing new grippers that could interface with the ABB YuMi and replace its default grippers with lightweight and cost-effective alternatives. I was also responsible for hardware maintenance, including part replacements, fixing electronic parts and circuitry-related failures, and implementing new design features. Ultimately, Dex-Net 3.0 was able to achieve success rates of 98%, 82%, and 58% on the "basic," "typical," and "adversarial" object categories, with adversarial performance improving to 81% when trained specifically on adversarial objects.
