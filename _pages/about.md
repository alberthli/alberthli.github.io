[[CV]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/cv/CV.pdf) (updated October 2023)

I am a Ph.D. student and [Kortschak Scholar](https://cms.caltech.edu/research/kortschak-scholars) studying Control and Dynamical Systems (CDS) in the [Computing and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) department at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). I am advised by Prof. Aaron Ames. My research interests lie in nonlinear control theory, safety, and the intersection between control theory and machine learning as applied to robotics, and in particular, dexterous manipulation.

I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from UC Berkeley in 2019 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University in 2021.
