[[CV]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/cv/CV.pdf) (updated February 2026)

I am a Ph.D. candidate and [Kortschak Scholar](https://cms.caltech.edu/research/kortschak-scholars) at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). I am advised by Yisong Yue and Richard Murray. My research interests lie in algorithms and models for dexterous manipulation and multimodal representation learning. In 2025, I was a research intern at [The Robotics and AI Institute](https://rai-inst.com/) (formerly the Boston Dynamics AI Institute) on the Dexterous and Mobile Manipulation team.

I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from UC Berkeley in 2019 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University in 2021.
