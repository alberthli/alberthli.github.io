[[CV]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/cv/CV.pdf)

I am a M.S. student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Stanford University conducting research with [Professor Monroe Kennedy III](https://monroekennedy3.com/) in the [Assistive Robotics and Manipulation (ARM) Lab](https://arm.stanford.edu/). My research interests are eclectic, spanning mechanical design + rapid prototyping, optimal + nonlinear control, dynamical modeling, and deep learning. I'm currently working on safe multi-agent control, human-robot collaboration, and deep dynamical learning in the meta-learning and reinforcement learning settings.

I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from UC Berkeley in 2019. As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to conduct research in Professor Ken Goldberg's [Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/), Professor Alice Agogino's [Berkeley Emergent Space Tensegrities Lab](https://best.berkeley.edu/), and Professor Koushil Sreenath's [Hybrid Robotics Lab](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/).

From January to August of 2018, I took a brief hiatus from school to work as an intern with the Apple Watch Product Design team. I worked on the Apple Watch Series 4 and 5 as well as research and development on new tactile sensing technologies. My day-to-day responsibilities consisted of run-of-the-mill product design tasks like statistical tolerance analysis, design reviews, and failure analysis trials with the reliability department.
