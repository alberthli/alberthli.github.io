[[CV]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/cv/CV.pdf)

I am a M.S. student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Stanford University conducting research with [Professor Monroe Kennedy III](https://monroekennedy3.com/) in the [Assistive Robotics and Manipulation (ARM) Lab](https://arm.stanford.edu/). In the fall of 2021, I will enter the Ph.D. program in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) under the Control and Dynamical Systems option, where my studies will be funded by a [Kortschak Scholarship](https://cms.caltech.edu/research/kortschak-scholars). My research interests lie in nonlinear control theory, safety, and the intersection between control theory and machine learning as applied to robotics.

I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from UC Berkeley in 2019. As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to conduct research in Professor Ken Goldberg's [Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/), Professor Alice Agogino's [Berkeley Emergent Space Tensegrities Lab](https://best.berkeley.edu/), and Professor Koushil Sreenath's [Hybrid Robotics Lab](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/).
