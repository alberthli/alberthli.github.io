I am a M.S. student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Stanford University conducting research with [Professor Monroe Kennedy III](https://monroekennedy3.com/) in the [Assistive Robotics and Manipulation (ARM) Lab](https://arm.stanford.edu/). My research interests are eclectic, spanning mechanical design + rapid prototyping, optimal + nonlinear control, dynamical modeling, and deep learning. I'm currently working on safe multi-agent control, human-robot collaboration, and deep dynamical learning in the meta-learning and reinforcement learning settings.

I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UC Berkeley in 2019. As an undergraduate, I was fortunate to conduct research in Professor Ken Goldberg's [Laboratory for Automation Science and Engineering](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/), Professor Alice Agogino's [Berkeley Emergent Space Tensegrities Lab](https://best.berkeley.edu/), and Professor Koushil Sreenath's [Hybrid Robotics Lab](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/).
