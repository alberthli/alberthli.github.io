## Policy Debate
For two years during my undergraduate career at UC Berkeley, I was a volunteer policy debate mentor for high school students. I worked with the [Bay Area Urban Debate League's](https://www.baudl.org/) outreach program, which paired mentors with low-resource schools in the Bay Area. My responsibitilies included weekly lectures on argumentative structure, research strategy, and scientific content, especially as related to robotics, automation, or artificial intelligence. I also had a special personal interest and experience in arguments related to [securitization in foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization_(international_relations)), psychoanalytic interpretations of public policy (e.g. [Anderson and White 2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0275074003251628)), and post-structuralist interpretations of ethics, media representations, international relations, and death (e.g. [Jean Baudrillard](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard)).

During my time as a mentor, I helped qualify 3 teams to the annual _Tournament of Champions_ held at the University of Kentucky, which admits only around 72 teams per year nationally. I also coached multiple teams to elimination rounds of the National Speech and Debate Assocation's annual national tournament, with one of my mentored teams reaching the finals out of thousands of qualifying teams nationwide. At the state level, my mentees also achieved significant success, appearing frequently in the elimination rounds of major tournaments while earning speaker awards. Many of my mentees went on study in STEM fields such as bioengineering, computer science, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering at schools like UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and Johns Hopkins.
