## Teaching Assistantships

- **Stanford - Spring 2021 - Advanced Dynamics, Controls and System Identification (ME334)**  
[[Evaluations]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/teaching_evals/me334_evals.pdf)  
This course discussed topics and methodologies for the analysis of rigid body dynamical systems, including frame transformations, derivation of equations of motion, constraints, D'Alembert's Principle, and both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. Secondarily, these concepts were then related to system identification and control theory. 8/12 of the students in the course submitted a specific evaluation for my performance.

- **Stanford - Fall 2020 - Dynamical Systems, Vibration, and Control (ME161)**  
[[Evaluations]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/teaching_evals/me161_evals.pdf)  
This course primarily focused on first and second-order linear ordinary differential equations, their solutions, characteristics of their time-domain responses, and step/harmonic inputs. In the included evaluations, 18/40 of the students in the course submitted a specific evaluation for my performance.
