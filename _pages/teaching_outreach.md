<summary><b>Stanford - Spring 2021 - Advanced Dynamics, Controls and System Identification (ME334)</b></summary>
<div class="boxed">

[[Evaluations]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/teaching_evals/me334_evals.pdf)

This course discusses topics and methodologies for the analysis of rigid body dynamical systems, including frame transformations, derivation of equations of motion, constraints, D'Alembert's Principle, and both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. Secondarily, these concepts are then related to system identification and control theory.

[[Evaluations]](http://alberthli.github.io/files/teaching_evals/me161_evals.pdf)

This course primarily focused on first and second-order linear ordinary differential equations, their solutions, characteristics of their time-domain responses, and step/harmonic inputs. In the included evaluations, 18/40 of the students in the course submitted a specific evaluation for my performance.

<!-- ## Policy Debate Mentorship
For two years during my undergraduate career at UC Berkeley, I was a volunteer policy debate mentor for high school students. I worked with the [Bay Area Urban Debate League's](https://www.baudl.org/) outreach program, which paired mentors with low-resource schools in the Bay Area. This coordination was done through UC Berkeley's BAUDL Bears program. I also remotely acted as a mentor outside of BAUDL for schools in California and Texas that solicited my help.

My responsibitilies included weekly lectures on argumentative structure, research strategy, and scientific content, especially as related to robotics, automation, or artificial intelligence. I also had a special personal interest and experience in arguments related to [securitization in foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization_(international_relations)), psychoanalytic interpretations of public policy (e.g. [Anderson and White (2003)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0275074003251628)), and post-structuralist interpretations of ethics, media representations, international relations, and death (e.g. [Jean Baudrillard](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard)).

During my time as a mentor, I helped qualify 3 teams to the annual _Tournament of Champions_ held at the University of Kentucky, which admits only around 72 teams per year nationally. I also coached multiple teams to elimination rounds of the National Speech and Debate Assocation's annual national tournament, with one of my mentored teams reaching the finals out of thousands of qualifying teams nationwide. At the state level, my mentees also achieved significant success, appearing frequently in the elimination rounds of major tournaments while earning speaker awards. Many of my mentees went on to study in STEM fields such as bioengineering, computer science, and chemical engineering at schools like UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and Johns Hopkins.

In addition to mentoring, I also participated as a judge in several major national tournaments such as UC Berkeley's annual tournament, and also served as a judge in other debate-related activities like the national Lincoln-Douglas circuit. -->
